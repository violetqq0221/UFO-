# Summary:
(1) the drawback of this websites: Need to type every letter in lower case letters and no spaces after at the end of text. 
(2) recommendation: 
* we should able to type with upper and lower cases to search.
* we can add the range of date search to search bar. Sightings occurs frequently particlly month instead of a particilally date 
* If can provide drop-down lists into the filed. it includes not only hightlighting search option when selected dropdown list.
